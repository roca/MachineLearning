Throughout 2020, Tesla delivered approximately 499 million vehicles and made $31.5 billion in revenue. In the first three quarters of 2023, the company delivered more than 1.3 million vehicles and already accrued more than $72 billion in revenue.\n",

For example, Lucid Motors (NASDAQ: LCID), another EV maker, joined Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS). Additionally, on November 13, the UK’s EG petrol station group announced it would acquire Tesla’s ultra-fast chargers to boost its own network.\n",

            "\n",
            "Finally, it is important not to look at Tesla’s share price in a vacuum. While it is similar to the values seen in late 2020, the company has achieved remarkable growth throughout the year and is up more than 100% since the start of the year. \n",

No matter where the company falls on the spectrum between a technology company and a car manufacturer, the EV maker has always held a key spot at the bleeding edge of electric vehicle innovation.', 'This is perhaps best exemplified by the relatively broad adoption of Tesla infrastructure by other players in the industry. For example, Lucid Motors (NASDAQ: LCID), another EV maker, joined Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS). Additionally, on November 13, the UK’s EG petrol station group announced it would acquire Tesla’s ultra-fast chargers to boost its own network.', 'Additionally, Tesla recently made a breakthrough in the manufacturing process itself, leading to the news that its Berlin plant is likely to begin the production of a new €25,000 model.', 'It is also possible that Tesla will enter a large, emerging EV market as soon as it is close to reaching an agreement with India’s government that would significantly reduce the country’s tariffs, according to a Financial TImes report from November 13.', 'Finally, it is important not to look at Tesla’s share price in a vacuum. While it is similar to the values seen in late 2020, the company has achieved remarkable growth throughout the year and is up more than 100% since the start of the year.', 'Additionally, it is handling the EV market slowdown comparatively well Tesla is maintaining its goal of 1.8 million vehicles.\\nTesla stock price analysis', 'Whatever the future may bring for the EV maker, its share price stands at $223.71 at the time of publication. Over the previous 24 hours, it rose 4.22%. Its numbers for the previous month – largely due to the aforementioned Q3 report – are somewhat weaker, and the company declined by 11.90%.']\n"
