If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack,
you must follow the steps in this page:

   https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/infra-manual/latest/developers.html

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at:

   https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/infra-manual/latest/developers.html#development-workflow

Release notes are managed through the tool
`reno <https://pypi.org/project/reno/>`_. This tool will create
a new file under the directory ``releasenotes`` that should
be checked in with the code changes.

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not GitHub:

   https://bugs.launchpad.net/pbr
