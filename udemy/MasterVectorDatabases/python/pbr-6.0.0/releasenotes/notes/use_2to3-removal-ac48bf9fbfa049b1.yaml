    The 2to3 conversion utility has been long discouraged in favor of writing
    multi-version-capable scripts. As of Setuptools 46.2.0 it's deprecated and
    slated for removal from the Python 3.10 standard library. Projects which
    still need it are encouraged to perform conversion prior to packaging. See
    https://bugs.python.org/issue40360 and
    https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2086 for more details.
