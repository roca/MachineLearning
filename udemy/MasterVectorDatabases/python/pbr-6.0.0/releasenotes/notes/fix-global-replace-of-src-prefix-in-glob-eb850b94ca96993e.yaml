    Fixes a bug where the directory names of items specified in ``data_files``
    could be renamed if the source prefix glob was contained within the
    directory name. See `bug 1810804
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/pbr/+bug/1810804>`_ for details. For more
    information on ``data_files``, see the `distutils documentation
    <https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files>`_.
